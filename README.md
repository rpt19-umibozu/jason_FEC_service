## Overview
The Photo Service Module includes a double, mini carousel inside a carousel feature made from scratch and was designed with service-oriented architecture as a microservice to compliment three other services (written by three other teammates) to create an Item Listing Page from a mockup.

### My contributions:

* Designed and built the Search Bar and Photo Service/Carousel Module.
* Coordinated and deployed entire application on a reverse proxy server using AWS EC2 instances.
* Utilized Agile (SCRUM) workflow practices on a 4 person remote team of engineers.
