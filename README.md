## Overview
Umibozu Photo Service Module with a double, mini carousel inside a carousel feature made from scratch, designed with Service-Oriented Architecture as a Microservice to compliment three other Microservices (written by the three other engineers on my team) to create an Item Listing Page from a mockup.

### My contributions:

* Designed and built the Search Bar and Photo Service/Carousel Module.
* Coordinated and deployed entire application on a reverse proxy server using AWS EC2 instances.
* Utilized Agile (SCRUM) workflow practices on a 4 person remote team of Software Engineers.
