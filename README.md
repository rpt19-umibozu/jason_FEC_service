## Overview
The Photo Service Module includes a double, mini carousel inside a carousel feature made from scratch and was designed with service-oriented architecture as a microservice to compliment three other services (written by three other teammates) to create an Item Listing Page from a mockup.

### My contributions:

* Designed and built the Search Bar / Photo Service / Carousel Modules.
* Coordinated and deployed entire teamâ€™s modules on a reverse proxy server using an AWS EC2 instance.
* Utilized agile workflow practices on a 4 person remote team.
